The Odds API covers the betting markets listed below.

## [#](https://the-odds-api.com/sports-odds-data/betting-markets.html#featured-betting-markets) Featured Betting Markets

These are the most common markets that are featured by bookmakers. Terminology for betting markets can vary by country, sport and even amongst bookmakers. We aim to simplify this by defining the following markets

| Market Key (use in the API) | Market Names | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| h2h | Head to head, Moneyline | Bet on the winning team or player of a game (includes the draw for soccer) |
| spreads | Points spread, Handicap | The spreads market as featured by a bookmaker. Bet on the winning team after a points handicap has been applied to each team |
| totals | Total points/goals, Over/Under | The totals market as featured by a bookmaker. Bet on the total score of the game being above or below a threshold |
| outrights | Outrights, Futures | Bet on a final outcome of a tournament or competition |
| h2h_lay | Same as h2h | Bet against a h2h outcome. This market is only applicable to betting exchanges |
| outrights_lay | Same as outrights | Bet against an outrights outcome. This market is only applicable to betting exchanges |

`spreads` and `totals` markets are mainly available for US sports and bookmakers at this time.

For descriptions of these markets, see [examples of betting markets](https://the-odds-api.com/sports-odds-data/betting-markets-examples.html).

## [#](https://the-odds-api.com/sports-odds-data/betting-markets.html#additional-markets) Additional Markets

Starting in 2023, more markets are becoming available in the API. Additional markets are currently limited to US sports and selected bookmakers, however coverage is expanding. Additional markets update at 1 minute intervals.

Due to the growing size of the API response, additional markets need to be accessed one event at a time using the new [`/events/{eventId}/odds` endpoint](https://the-odds-api.com/liveapi/guides/v4/#endpoint-5).

| Market Key (use in the API) | Market Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| alternate_spreads | Alternate Spreads (handicap) | All available point spread outcomes for each team |
| alternate_totals | Alternate Totals (Over/Under) | All available over/under outcomes |
| btts | Both Teams to Score | Odds that both teams will score during the game. Outcomes are "Yes" or "No". Available for soccer. |
| draw_no_bet | Draw No Bet | Odds for the match winner, excluding the draw outcome. A draw will result in a returned bet. Available for soccer |
